         Some years ago I made a small path by walking back and forth everyday over a grassy area in a park next to my home. This was after a period that spawned several political activities, including demonstrations that I hadn’t seen manifested in traces on the streets or in the media. In response, I assigned a press photographer to document my attempted path for a newspaper.        </p>

         My proposal for Jet is personal and connected to that old intervention. On Friday the 16th of December 2006, a demonstration in my neighborhood turned into a street riot. Many streets were blocked. Several new riots occurred this month, attracting much media attention.        </p>

         Late Friday that December, after some days of being willingly isolated in my home, I was trying to work on the show for Jet. Not knowing what to do, I was trying to make reference to the term nonperformance, in other words, failure. I ended up having to go out onto the streets in order to buy some food in the nearest late night supermarket. It was cold and moist outside.        </p>
