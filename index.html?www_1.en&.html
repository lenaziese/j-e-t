         Norbert Kottmann and Ella Ziegler approach the present from opposite points of view to find productive new perspectives:        </p>

         The world as a totally built-up, developed and administered whole serves Norbert Kottmann as the basis for his artistic works. Within this framework, he discovers what he calls “open spaces” that are then used as points of departure for artworks, but which also serve as surfaces on which to project these works. He devises scenarios that do not claim to be practicable or immediately applicable solutions. The viewer, who is expected to think on from the visual and intellectual material proposed by the artist and thus compete the work, is a necessary part of that work. The fact that the direction to be taken is largely predefined is part of a decidedly moralistic position whose roots lie in a belief in art as a way of resisting the futility of all action.        </p>

         Ella Ziegler scans the details of the everyday for the incidental aspects that bring them alive. Her approach actually consists of nothing more than searching, highlighting and focussing. Perception of the peripheral phenomena and side effects of her life supply the points of departure for her artistic works. For her, the key moments are those that give rise to a many-layered network of relationships between cause and effect, public and private, collective and individual. Ella Ziegler combines the existing with the possible, thus breaking down these categories. Her intention is “to access the place between the present and the unknown.” (Ella Ziegler)        </p>
